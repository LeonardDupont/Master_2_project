# Master_2_project repository

This folder contains codes on MATLAB that were used from January 2019 to July 2019
in the team of Dr. Megan Carey (FChampalimaud, Lisbon). 

These codes mostly take part in an attempt to create an automated pipeline for the analysis of 1P, in vivo calcium data.
Only codes with a header comprising my name were written by myself. All of them are under copyright. 


## Folders

The repository contains a few folders: 

###### Ca_pipeline_utils 
Contains functions that are used to analyse the 1P microscopy data, going from pixel photon counts to processed fluorescence traces or spiketrains. 
###### Bhv_pipeline_utils
Contains functions that are used to process behavioural data.
###### Elliptical demixing
Contains functions which are all implemented in the demixing protocol following a FISSA(Keeminsk et al. 2018)-like procedure. 
###### Clustering
Contains functions that allow to cluster cells or pixels based on different criteria and using different methods.
###### WS 
Contains Working Scripts (WS) from 1 to 3 that summarize the analysis pipeline. These scripts can be copied and adapted to each new dataset. 
###### Others
Other stuff. Very little actually.
