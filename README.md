Master_2_project

This folder contains codes on MATLAB that were used from January 2019 to July 2019
in the team of Dr. Megan Carey (FChampalimaud, Lisbon). 

These codes mostly take part in an attempt to create an automated pipeline for the analysis of 1P, in vivo calcium data.
Only codes with a header comprising my name were written by myself. All of them are under copyright.
